I want to build a research agent like perplexity.ai
The agent is powered by the kimi k2.5 model via their official API and duckduckgo mcp

Doc URLS:
moonshot api developer docs for kimi k2.5 - https://platform.moonshot.ai/docs/overview
duckduckgo mcp - https://github.com/nickclyde/duckduckgo-mcp-server

Tech Stack:
Django
Tailwind for style (via cdn)
Alpine.JS for page reactivity (via cdn)

NOTE: This is a technical demo so don't spend too much time on implementation accuracy, goal is to
implement features & ensure those features are secure without any vulnerabilities. I have already
created a boilerplate django project - axiom, start building from here

1.  Basic Django login system
2.  Chatbot app inspired by t3.chat perplexity.ai, chatgpt.com, claude.ai
3.  Keep the website theme very minimalistic, function over features
4.  Simple toggleable sidebar showing chat session history
5.  Chatbox in the bottom center, no need for model selection dropdown etc..
6.  Minimal chatbox that can accept multi-line input via shift+enter and only enter submits prompt
7.  + icon in the chatbox that opens file explorer to allow attaching images (only images)
8.  caching/compression strategies as required to keep image/long chat sessions sizes small enough
      to have quick responses
9.  Only dark theme
10. duckduckgo mcp is the core of the chat experience as it allows model to respond accurately with
      latest info

Beyond this you are allowed to make other technical decisions on the fly as required, I just wanna
  see outputs.
