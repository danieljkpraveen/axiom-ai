Search Migration Notes
======================

As of February 16, 2026, Axiom no longer uses DuckDuckGo MCP for retrieval.

What changed:
- Removed `duckduckgo-mcp-server` and `mcp` usage from the app runtime.
- Text prompts now use Moonshot tool-calling with `$web_search`.
- Default search model is `moonshot-v1-auto` (configurable via env).

New env variables:
- `MOONSHOT_SEARCH_MODEL` (default: `moonshot-v1-auto`)
- `MOONSHOT_ENABLE_WEB_SEARCH` (default: `true`)

Operational effect:
- No local MCP process is launched for chat requests.
- Previous DDG redirect/timeouts and MCP exception noise should not occur.
